## Requirements
1. Do not use class components. Hooks have everything you need.

3. Once all fields are filled up, the Next button should be enabled.
4. Every time the keyboard is active, the Next button must be above the keyboard at all times. To better describe this requirement, I have uploaded a video from the Target app to demonstrate this:
